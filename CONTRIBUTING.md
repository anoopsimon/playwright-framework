Acceptance Criteria

User Story:
As a developer, I want to create the smallest service stub for the ABC application to mock an HTTP REST API response.

Acceptance Criteria:

	1.	Basic Valid Token Request:
	•	Given a mock REST API server is implemented,
	•	When it receives a POST request to request a system token for the ABC application with valid parameters (such as scope and other required information in the payload),
	•	Then it should return a JSON response with a valid JWT token according to the HTTP REST protocol.
	2.	Advanced Use Case (Not in Scope):
	•	Note: Advanced scenarios such as handling invalid system token requests, returning bad request responses, or providing incorrect tokens for different use cases are not within the scope of this user story.
