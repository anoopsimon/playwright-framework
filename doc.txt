User Story:
As a developer, I want to create a structure for the mocking solution within the application so that I can efficiently test and develop against predictable and controlled service responses.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given the mock service is implemented and it is ready to be used and configured in the application,
When the docker image of this mocking solution is built,
Then it should be able to spin up a container that hosts the mock server using the Flimflam solution on localhost or a hosted server.

Given the mock service is part of the applicationâ€™s deployment process,
When the docker-compose file is used to deploy the application in test environments,
Then the mock server container should be spun up as part of the whole deployment process,
And access to this running container of the mock service should be enabled so that it can be configured in the application once it is deployed.

This format ensures that all necessary steps and conditions are clear and that the mock service integrates smoothly into your deployment process.
